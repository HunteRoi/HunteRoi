<h3>What about me? 🧍‍♂</h3>

I am a young developer living in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linssen/country-flag-icons/master/images/svg/bel.svg" alt="🇧🇪" width="16" height="16" /> Belgium.
I am passionate of IT, which you can quickly understand if you google-search me: I maintain [a personal blog](https://tinaeldevresse.eu/blog) about IT and try to have a strong presence in the open-source world.

I like to talk with end users to understand their needs, and tailor the solution to resolve their problems. I believe that it is necessary to understand the domain and expertise for which we work in order to make a digital solution that is useful and reliable.

On my spare time I enjoy helping others understand concepts, learn new things or build up their ideas. I also do some sports like cycling 🚴‍♂ or going to the gym 🏋‍♂. I am trying to be a good cook 👨‍🍳 because I absolutely love eating. Hope we’ll get to know each other around a meal!!

<h3>What are my current interests? 📝</h3>

I try to help wherever I can.

<h4>→ Organizations 👨‍👧‍👦</h4>

I am a member of a few organizations that I want to help. Most of my time is spent on projects from [Blargbot](https://github.com/blargbot) and [Section IG](https://github.com/section-ig).

<h4>→ Projects 📑</h4>
Whether it is for various organizations or for myself, I like to develop stuff. Here is a sample of my works:

- [Reach The Levels](https://github.com/hunteroi/reach-the-levels), a website-based application to motivate people to finish projects by gaining points and utilizing those to get rewards.
- [DoOld](https://github.com/hunteroi/do-old), an edited clone of Doodle but the old fashion way: just book days and not time slots!
- [DataDrop](https://github.com/section-IG/DataDrop), a tailored Discord bot for servers made by/for students of the Henallux (a v2 is on its way!).
- [AnimesList](https://github.com/hunteroi/animeslist), a small anime website for personal use.
- [Local Recipes](https://github.com/hunteroi/local-recipes), a small recipes website for personal use.
- and more like [discord-server-generator](https://github.com/HunteRoi/discord-server-generator), [discord-selfrole](https://github.com/HunteRoi/discord-selfrole), [discord-temp-channels](https://github.com/HunteRoi/discord-temp-channels), [discord-mailbox](https://github.com/HunteRoi/discord-mailbox), ... !
